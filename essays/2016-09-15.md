My initial thoughts on Configuration Management were not the best.  The thought of having to build entire systems from the ground up intimidated me. However, when I began to work with GitHub I discovered the build of a system was exactly the same as a computer's hard drive, with folders containing files.  At the same time, due to my unfamiliarity with Configuration Management, I have encountered several problems that didn't have an obvious solution for someone with my level of experience.  It was quite frustrating to say the least.  However, I am confident that I will use GitHub to its full potential in the future.

In my opinion, git is popular because of GitHub.  GitHub is an easy platform to use, and with it's desktop application, programmers can build systems on the fly and syncing them later on.  The biggest advantage of GitHub for desktop is the fact that it doesn't require an internet connection to build a system.
