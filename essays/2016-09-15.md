My initial thoughts on Configuration were not the best.  The thought of having to build entire systems from the ground up intimidated me. However, when I began to work with GitHub I discovered the build of a system was exactly the same as a computer's hard drive, with folders containing files.  At the same time, due to my unfamiliarity with Configuration Management, I have encountered several problems that didn't have an obvious solution with my level of experience with it.  It was quite frustrating to say the least.
