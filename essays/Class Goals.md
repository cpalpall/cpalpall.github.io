Ever since my childhood, videogames were a passion I have had.  This love of games eventually evolved into a love of technology. I realized that I loved working with computers and aspired to make it into a living of mine.

Although programming was a daunting task at first, I perservered and managed to learn java, C and C++.  I had a lot of fun down the road and I am now moving from simple projects in programming to making full fledged software.  In this class I hope to learn more about the concepts of software engineering, such as designs, interfaces and finding a way to implement them in ways outside of the field of technology.
