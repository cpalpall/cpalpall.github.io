Meteor takes everything we have learned so far (Semantic UI, HTML, javascript) and mixes them all into one convenient, but not so easy to understand package.  I ran into a slew of troubles here and there, but overall it was a rewarding experience.

My first troubles came from actually running programs properly.  During the Digits 1 Assignment, most of, if not all of the class had troubles getting the program to run. It involved a lot of troubleshooting, reinstalling, and updating until it finally worked.  It's a hassle to have things break due to updates and patches, but when working with computers you just need to get used to it and work to figure out a fix.

My other main trouble is one that has happened far too often: forgetting to change the names of elements or closing statements.  I have spent countless times of scanning through my code or rewatching parts of the WOD demonstrations, all for a single typo.  Even the basics come back to haunt experts.

Thankfully actually building meteor apps didn't come with any serious problems besides the two mentioned above.
