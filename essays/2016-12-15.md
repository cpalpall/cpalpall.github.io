Ever since taking up Software Engineering, my viewpoint in life has changed quite a bit.  A prominent example of this is the difference in how I perceive interactions in videogames.  Simple things like getting hit by something results in you taking damage or going to a certain location triggers a cutscene are all caused by the programming behind it.

One game that I have spent countless hours (and money) on is [Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/), an online collectible card game by Blizzard.  I won't go into great detail about how to play the game (if you are interested, the link above has a nice guide on it), but I will cover the "underlying code" behind one of the core gameplay mechanics in Hearthstone: playing cards.

Here are a couple of cards I will use to help explain myself:
<img class="ui image" src="/images/Cards.png">

Every card has a <strong>Cost</strong> to play, which is denoted by the number on its top left corner.  Each player has a <strong>Mana pool</strong> which determines the number of cards they can play per turn.  The cost of a card being played is deducted from the player's current mana pool and if you have less mana then the cost of a card, you cannot play that card.

Let's say I have four Mana.  Of the three cards pictured above, I decide to play Angry Chicken. Since Angry Chicken has a Cost of one, I now have three Mana remaining.  I would be unable to play Sen'jin Shieldmaster or Leeroy Jenkins due to them having a Cost of four and five respecitvely. 

On the other hand if I had ten Mana, I would be able to play all three cards due to their costs being exactly ten in total.

Applying the rules behind playing a card into simple javascript javascript it would look something like this:

var board = new Array[]       //board is the field in which we play the cards

function play(card) {

    if (card.cost <= currentMana) {
        currentMana = currentMana - card.cost;
        console.log(card + " has been played.");
        board.push(card)
       } 
    else {
       console.log("Error: Not enough mana to play " + card)
        }
    return;
}

There are numerous other "underlying codes" behind in-game interactions but this was definitely one of the simpler ones to explain.  I hope I showed you a bit of the light in regards to how programming can be applied to many different aspects of life.
