Ever since my childhood, videogames were a passion I have had.  This love of games eventually evolved into a love of technology. I realized that I loved working with computers and aspired to make it into a living of mine.  I want to contribute to the rapid growth in the technology industry in this day and age.

Although programming was a daunting task at first, I perservered and managed to learn java, C and C++.  I had a lot of fun down the road and I am now moving from simple projects in programming to making full fledged software.  In this class I hope to learn more about the concepts of software engineering, such as designs, interfaces and finding a way to implement them in ways outside of the field of technology.

I wish to combine my passion of technology with another passion of mine: music.  A lot of today's music is being generated on computers and I had the experience of actually using recording technology in my guitar class during my junior and senior years of high school.  It was an amazing experience that made me consider how synergistic the two fields can be.  Technology isn't used to just make music, but also distributing it as well. Services such as iTunes, Soundcloud and Bandcamp allow people to sell their own music or buy other people's music.  Compared to a record store, the amount of selections to choose from is infinitely greater.
