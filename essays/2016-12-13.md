It's been a long four months but the journey through ICS 314 is coming to a close.  Looking back on it, I've learned many different aspects of coding such as Javascript and HTML. I also had my first experience with User Interfaces in the form of Semantic UI.  But I felt like the most important experience for me in this class was the Athletic Software Engineering Aspect.

It was a difficult task to keep up with the demand but I found it to be very effective way to learn.  The pressure was reminiscint of an actual work environment with strict deadlines that have to be met.  One of my friends even fell too far behind on the WODs and dropped out of the class about a month in. While I was a little saddened, I knew it was an unfortunate inevitability that some people would be unable to keep up with the workload.  However, the more I perservered and practiced, I could find myself improving, knowing the proper code to write and being able to write them out much faster than I did the previous day.  At times, I found myself spending up to an hour and a half on a single homework assignment just to see the fastest possible time I could achieve.

Despite the high demands of the class, I had a lot of fun in it.  Professor Johnson, while a bit eccentric, was a fantastic teacher who demonstrated not only great knowledge in his field of study, but a passion for it as well.
