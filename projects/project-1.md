The Eagle Scout is the highest obtainable rank in the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).  Approximately only 4% of Boy Scouts actually reach this rank and it is held in high regard by many peers. Some famous Eagle Scouts include: the first man on the moon Neil Armstrong, former US President Gerald Ford, Sam Walton the founder of Wal Mart and Sams Club and television star Mike Rowe.

One of the primary, and often times most difficult, requirements in order to receive this rank is to do an Eagle Project.  An Eagle Project is a community service project that produces a positive outcome in the scout's community.  Planning and leading is to be done by the Eagle Scout candidate himself.

For this project, I planned to prepare 50+ bentos and handing them out to the homeless living at the Neal Blaisdell Park.  In order to accrue funds for the supplies, I requested donations from family, friends, my fellow scouts and other organizations such as churches and hospitals.  Approximately $2,000 in donations were received to fund the project.  

The project was held at Kahikuonalani Church, the sponsor of my Boy Scout Troop. I tasked some scouts with cooking meats such as chicken and hotdogs, while others put the food into the bento boxes in an assembly line.  After the bentos were completed, me and several members of the church drove to Neal Blaisdell Park to deliver the bentos.
