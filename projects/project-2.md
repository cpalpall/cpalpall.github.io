summary: Constructing my own PC for my own use and experience.

For an ICS major, the computer is where the magic happens.  But chances are more than likely that they didn't achieve much success with a cheap laptop with bottom of the barrel equipment, unless it's simple programming like java. They're more likely to use more advanced computers that are faster and more better equipped for heavy duty work.

One of my personal goals while being an ICS major is to be able to build my own computer, both for personal and professional.  I wish to learn about the different parts of my computer and how each of them work in unison to make a computer run.  

Currently my planned build is the following: (http://pcpartpicker.com/list/7rDK3F).
