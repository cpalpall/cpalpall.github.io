[Manoa Dojo](https://github.com/manoa-dojo/manoa-dojo) is a group project created in collaboration with [Ryan Barsatan](https://ryanbars.github.io/), [Xen Huang](https://xenhuang.github.io/), [Stephen Mau](https://smau4.github.io/), and myself. The purpose of Manoa Dojo is to allow ICS students to create study groups to cover material in a course. Students can identify themselves as either a Sensei, one who teaches class materials, or a Grasshopper, one who wishes to learn.  

<h1>User Features</h1>

Manoa Dojo has the following features:

<h2>My Contributions to Manoa Dojo</h2>
One of my earliest contributions to Manoa Dojo was logo for it. After our group came up with the name "Manoa Dojo", I decided to make the logo look Eastern-styled, since a dojo is a place where martial arts are practiced.  The green and white color of the logo was meant to make it resemble the University of Hawaii logo.  Four versions of the logo were created before we voted on the one you can see on the webapp today.

My second major contribution was the Leaderboard. In order to keep the theme of dojo, I incorporated belts of different colors.  Just like belts in Karate and martial arts, the belts in Manoa Dojo represented your progress and "rank" amongst the users.  Originally, belts were supposed to be a counter for a user's rank in the leaderboard (i.e black belt for the #1 ranked user, white for the lowest ranked user), however it wasn't a very good comparison since you can't drop down in belt ranks in real life martial arts, and there are only so many belts that some users may not even get a belt of their own.  So in order to make things more fair and realistic, the belts now display for each user with their designated rank based on participation.

Other contributions included deployment and minor spell and grammar checks.

<h2>Reflections</h2>

If I learned one thing from this project, it would be the importance of teamwork when working in a group.  I myself wasn't feeling too confident in my javascript; I knew what I had to do but didn't always know the proper way to implement it.  Thankfully my group members were able to cover for me and clean up my code to get it to work properly.  Likewise, I was the only member of my group to have experience with photoshop, which came in handy when making a logo and other pictures.  Each of us brought a specific set of skills to the table when helping design Manoa Dojo. All of us applying these different skills eventually culminated in the completed version of Manoa Dojo.
